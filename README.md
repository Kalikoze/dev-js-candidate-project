# Spruce Labs, Developer Candidate Project

Greetings Spruce Labs prospective candidate! If you're reading this, that means that we already think that you're awesome and we want to get a taste of your superpowers.  We feel that traditional code tests are boring and shallow. As such, we believe that the best way to get a flavor for what-you-do is to bring an idea to life!  So, what does that mean? That means that we'll be leaving most of the decisions about what and how to build this mini-project completely up to you.  Of course we want to see beautiful code and technical wizardry, but, just as important to us is your approach and creative execution - we'll want to hear all about your strategy and design of the featureset.  The ultimate goal here is to learn a lot about you.  Inevitably, through the process of this work - you will also learn a lot about us.  We hope you enjoy the test, and that you build something that you are proud enough to share with the world.  We are beyond excited to see what you come up with...

## Project Overview

Your mission, if you choose to accept it is to : build a chatbot with a web-based user interface.  The purpose of this chatbot is to make people laugh. At the highest level, the user story for this project is : "As a user, I should laugh as a result of interacting with this chatbot".

**Key Strategic Insight :**
One of the most universally common questions to chatbots is : "Tell me a joke"

## Design / High-Fidelity Wireframes
We've taken the liberty of creating a high-fidelity wireframe for what your bot should look like.  This is intended to serve as a sketch, not a blueprint.  Ultimately, the visual interface is your decision and this is not an exercise in comp-matching, although there are times when that is important to us... Basically, make it work well and make it beautiful.

## Objectives

- Build a functional chatbot and deploy it to someplace it can be seen and played with.
- Deliver a codebase that you are proud of, quality over quantity of functionality - we realize that our candidates are busy.
- Build a beautiful interface based on the high-fidelity wireframes provided above.
- Document your application and be prepared to demo both the functionality and codebase to our team.
- Be able to present your work during a 30minute review session with our product and engineering teams.

## Requirements
We'd think it's really cool if you use pieces of our stack (nudge, nudge, wink, wink):
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [ReduxJS](https://redux.js.org/)
- [NextJS](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) or [KoaJS](http://koajs.com/)

and deployed it to [Heroku](https://heroku.com) ðŸ˜‰ 

## Expectations
- That your app is running at a domain that we can view
- That you have built a visual interface for web-based chat
- That your visual interface connects to an API or backend of some sort
- That a user can ask it "Tell me a joke" and it responds with - something...
- That you deliver a codebase that you feel represents your potential and virtues that you would bring to Spruce Labs.
